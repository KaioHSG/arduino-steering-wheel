# ArduinoSteeringWheel (need update)
Using just an encoder, a potentiometer for each pedal and an Arduino (only Leonardo tested) it is possible to create a huge steering wheel. Instructions within the code.

* Requires libraries:

[ArduinoJoystickLibrary](https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary) by MHeironimus.

[Encoder](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Encoder) by PaulStoffregen.
