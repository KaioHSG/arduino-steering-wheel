# Arduino Steering Wheel (need update)

Using just an encoder, a potentiometer for each pedal and an Arduino (only Leonardo tested) it is possible to create a huge steering wheel. Instructions within the code.

## Requires libraries:

* [ArduinoJoystickLibrary](https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary) by MHeironimus.
* [Encoder](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Encoder) by PaulStoffregen.
